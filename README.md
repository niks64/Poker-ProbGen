## How it Works
1. Storing hands and table information 
...Structured classes are made for the cards, hand, player and table. This allows me to create a definition header file that is imported into the lowest level and can be accessed by each class. The suits and values of the cards are represented using enums which makes it easy to convert them to symbols and integers for printing and other functions.
2. TwoPlusTwo table generation
